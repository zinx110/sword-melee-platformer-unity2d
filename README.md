# sword-melee-platformer-unity2d
A unity2d game I tried making for learning unity2d and game making. What I added in it:
-	Custom player movement scripts, hp, damage management, respawning
-	Simple mob ai (basically just checks if player is visible, go to player if visible, attack if in range, simple basic stuffs)
-	Multi-level, A boss at the end of levels (just a larger, slower, and a bit more powerful version of mobs)
