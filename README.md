# sword-melee-platformer-unity2d
A unity2d game i tried making for learning unity2d and game making. 
What i added in it:
 - Custom player momvement scripts
 - hp and damage manaement
 - multi level
 - player respawn
 - simple mob ai (basically just checks if player is visible, go to player if visible, attack if in range, kinda simple)
 - A boss at the end of levels (just a larger, slower, and a bit more powerful version of mobs)
